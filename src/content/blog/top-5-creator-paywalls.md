Let's face it, Notion is a great tool for content creators. It's easy to use, has a lot of features, and is a great way to organize your content. But what happens when you want to paywall other content? Many creators love creating a variety of types of content and would love to monetize all of it, not just the content they create in Notion. That's what sets us apart from Notion-only paywalls. But without gassing ourselves up too much, let's look at some of the other Paywalls out there.

### 1. Notion Paywall

Notion-paywall is a Next.js paywall solution that allows you to monetize your Notion content directly within the platform and publish it on your own web domain. It's a great way to monetize your Notion content without having to leave the platform.

Pros:

* Seamless integration with existing Notion content
* Easy to set up for Notion users
* Supports recurring subscriptions

Cons:

* Limited to Notion content only
* Lacks advanced customization options
* May not be ideal for creators with content across multiple platforms

### 2. Sotion

Sotion is a dedicated paywall solution designed specifically for Notion users who want more control over their monetization.
Pros:

* Built specifically for Notion, ensuring compatibility
* Offers more customization than Notion's native paywall
* Provides analytics and subscriber management tools

Cons:

* Still limited to Notion content
* May require more setup than the native Notion paywall
* Additional cost on top of Notion subscription

### 3. Portcullis

Portcullis supports gating content from over 10 different content sources. This means you can paywall content from Coda, Figma, Miro, Cal.com, Obsidian, and more. You can even paywall content from your own website after going through a application process. 

What's more, we allow you to create multiple paywalls for each content source. This means you can paywall content from different sources in different ways. For example, you could paywall content from your website with a free trial and paywall content from Coda with a one-time payment.

Let's take a look at how it works:

```html
<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: calc(50.82758620689655% + 41px); height: 0; width: 100%;"><iframe src="https://demo.arcade.software/pnN0vdggcWu7GHf9dfmz?embed&show_copy_link=true" title="Portcullis 101" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen allow="clipboard-write" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;color-scheme: light;"></iframe></div>
```

### 4. Outseta

Outseta is a great option for creators who need a bit more than just content gating and need to provide more robust features such as login and membership management.

We're big fans of Outseta and love it's ability to support Stripe payments, authentication, CRM, email all in one. Outseta gives founders the tools to monetize their website, SaaS product, or online community in minutes.

### 5. Memberspace


Memberspace is a versatile paywall solution that can be integrated with various platforms, including custom websites and content management systems.

Pros:

Cons:

* May require more technical setup compared to platform-specific solutions
