I love competition to be honest, and I've never been afraid of sharing my ideas in the open with the world. It's always been my belief that if someone can do what I'm building better, then let them, but I'm fully confident in my ability to mix creative means with heuristics to spin together products that compete in ways that are hard to replicate.

One of Portcullis's main competitors is [Gumroad](https://www.gumroad.com), and I think we're in a good spot to shake up the 49% hold they have on the market considering their reputation and consumer sentiments gathered from social media. 

### Bootstrapping, but like actually

One of the big things I want to do differently from Sahil is to bootstrap Portcullis as much as possible, but like, actually. (Not going from bootstrap, to VC, to bootstrap again)

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Gumroad is the ultimate example of startup B.S.<br><br>2012: Gumroad raises $8.1M in VC money.<br><br>2012-2019: Gumroad fails to achieve hockey stick growth.<br><br>2019: Investors take the write-off and sell Gumroad back to the founder for $1.00.<br><br>(cont.)</p>&mdash; Matt Paulson (@MattPaulsonSD) <a href="https://twitter.com/MattPaulsonSD/status/1614038190700085249?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 13, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 

I plan to raise a $520k pre-seed from angels and friends, and I'm confident we can build the rest of the way by simply running SEM against the Gumroad brand to grab that brand value. 

### Fair-source and community led

One of the things that I'm really excited about with this project is that we're going to be running a fair-source and community led project. All of our creators have a say in how the product is built, and the features that go into the product.

We eventually will be launching a Discord for the Portcullis creator network, and we're going to be running a lot of community driven contests and events to get the community involved in the product.

That's another area I feel like Sahil neglected, because while Gumroad had and relied on the community to grow, it never actually put the community first. By taking the opposite approach, we're going to be able to build a product that is truly community driven.

### The future of social commerce

For us to really compete with Gumroad, we're going to get creative with our features and our approach to the market. Some of the things I've got planned in my head have never been done in the social commerce space, and I'm excited to see how they'll work out.


#### Portcullis Marketplace

Obviously, we're going to be building a marketplace for creators to sell their products. This is going to be done with a lot of thought and care, and we're going to be building a lot of features that Gumroad doesn't have, so if you'd like to be a part of the early days of this project, please reach out to me on WhatsApp.

#### Metrics and reporting

One of the things that were specifically asked for from our Product Hunt launch is a way to get analytics and metrics for individual products. I'm actually working on that personally right now using [analytics.js](https://github.com/segmentio/analytics.js/). 

Which is going to be extremely powerful because it will adhere to the Segment spec, and creators will be able to not only track their metrics, but also instrument events with Segment using things like the Customer.io destination, or identify visitors with the Segment Identify API.

#### Secret Labs

One of the concepts I have planned at the moment is a secret project involving IFrames that broke off from the original Portcullis iteration. I can't say much about it, but it's going to be pretty wild and the partnerships potential in it is huge.

### Financials

The reason I say we can bootstrap this project and reach scale is that we're going to be taking advantage of as many low-CAC channels as possible while leveraging the values of our community to grow organically. 

As far as the financials go, we're planning to start off by raising a $520k pre-seed from angels and friends, and from there I believe our main KPI should be to reach 250 creators on the platform, which would be significantly past the break-even point for a prospective investor at the pre-seed stage. 

This should be achievable in 6-12 month targeting SEM against Gumroad and other creator keywords such as Notion and Coda templates, and I'm confident we can reach that goal by Q3 2025.

If you're interested in investing with us, please shoot me a message on  WhatsApp.


## Conclusion: The future of Portcullis

Taking on the incumbent is never easy, but I'm confident we can do it with the right reasources and the right team. If you're interested in collaborating with me on this project, please reach out to me on WhatsApp.
