In an ecosystem where buzzwords and marketing fluff dominate the discourse around products, it's easy to get lost in the smoke and mirrors. We live in a system designed to obfuscate real value and often replace it with percieved value. It took me a while to realize that one of the best ways to counter this trend and set yourself apart is to stand by your product and drink your own champagne. 

Over the past month, I've been building a fair-sourced Gumroad alternative called Portcullis that went through a few directions and concepts before I thought sat down and had a conversation with myself about what I would want out of a product like this as a user.

## Pattern recog go brrrrr....

Over time I came to the conclusion that the 3 most important things for me were:

- 1. Transparency
- 2. Zero or low fees
- 3. Community

After I started building, something different happened compared to projects I've done in the past. First, I started to build for the user in myself, and not for the founder in myself. This might sound very abstract and philosophical, but internally it 100% changed the way I built. See, something I believe is that there are absolutely static patterns in the market that determine what features are successful. 

## Stop shipping shit ðŸ’©

We can preach the "Just ship it" methodolgy all we want, but the reality is that there are certain features that are more likely to be successful than others. And this isn't meant to say that Portcullis is a perfect or flawless app, but it was built with the clear patterns of it's niches users in mind.

For example, if you're building a product for the creator economy, you're going to want to build features that are more likely to be successful in that space. If you're building a product for the enterprise market, you're going to want to build features that are more likely to be successful in that space. These are patterns that can't be argued. 

Maybe instead of shipping things just to ship them, an alternative method is to first identify the niche your product is meant to serve, and then via your own heurisitcs or some other reasearch method, identify the feature patterns that are most likely to be successful in that niche.

## Applying these ideas internally

The first iteration of the payment portal used IFrames, and while I really liked the approach, it would have really required a lot of work to secure and could have left a lot of unanswered questions for the user as far as security of their products from piracy goes.

Eventually, I opted to switch to a regular dynamica portal much like Gumroad, knowing that it would be more secure, and would allow me to build a more robust and feature rich product.

So with that being said, when I started applying my pattern matching concepts internally, the feedback (and results) were amazing. A few key things started happening. First, I began receiving 100% more excited feedback about the onboarding and portal process. Next, signups have begun skyrocketing with direct attribution to the change on the homepage to the dogfooded portal. While I liked the IFrame approach, it was clear that the portal was the way to go.

## What's next?

From here, I plan to continue building out the portal, and dig into dogfooding quite a bit. The design has a ton of potential and some of the things I've like to add dynamism to the design are:

- Colors
- Auto-generated images
- Feature bullet points

This is only the beginning of the journey, and I'm excited to see where it goes.

## Conclusion

I hope this post has been helpful in understanding the importance of dogfooding and how it can be used to improve your product. By understanding the patterns of your niche and building for the user in yourself, you can create a product that is more likely to be successful.
